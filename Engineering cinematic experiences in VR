Engineering cinematic experiences in VR

https://events.google.com/io2016/schedule?sid=64d50c09-0cef-e511-a517-00155d5066d7#day1/64d50c09-0cef-e511-a517-00155d5066d7

1. Look around - 360 degrees
2. Depth of field - stereoscopic
3. Spatial Audio
4. JUMP - VR creation platform
	a. Camera spec
	b. assembler - stictching
	c. Playback - Youtube
5. Video Projections & Playback
	a. How to create immersion
		1. Pick a sphere to plane projection to represent 360 video
		2. Increase video resolution until pixels >= display + optics
		3. Double resolution to account for stereo
	b. Globe -> Map
	c. Approximating resolution
		1. 2560 hor pix/2 eye = 1280 pix
		2. 1280 pix/100 degrees field of view = 12.8 pix/degree
		3. 12.8 pix/degree x 360 horizontal degrees = 4608 pixels
		4. 4608x2304 pix = 10.6 MP (mono)
		5. 4608x4608 = 21.2 MP (stereo)
		6. 3840x2160 = 8.3 MP (4k)
		7. +27% over 4K res for mono, +155% for stereo
	d. Projection challenges
		a. Impossible to project sphere to plane without stretching (Peel orange)
		b. Visual quality changes based on user view direction (because of 1)
		c. Need to consider best and worst areas of visual quality
			1. Earth - Poles best quality and equator worst
			2. Same for picture - top bottom more pix and middle less pix
			3. Cubemap - beast at periphery of cube map and worst at centre of cubemap
			4. Equiangular cube map
6. Spatial Audio
	a. Fully represents sound space - where its coming from
	b. Loction in space, Capture the environment, immerse the listener
	c. 2 ears - headphones - 2 channel audio - stream 
	d. Latency makes poor audio experience
	e. Full audio scene - Surround sound - for front facing experience
	f. Object based audio
		1. for each source mono audio + metadata
		2. Similar to audio exp for games
		3. Great for post production
		4. More sources -> more data for objs
	g. Ambisonics
		1. Full sphere spatial audio
		2. Scene based rep - approx of scene
		3. great for streaming
	h. First order ambisonics
		1. 2 mics -> stereo image
		2. 3D extension of mid side stereo - vritual micrphones on sphere
		3. Spehrical harmonics - omnidirn, left right, top bottom etc
		4. Room for improvement
	i. Higher order ambisonics
		1. infinetly extensible
		2. Third order
		3. better performance
	j. Streaming ambisonics
		1. Audio tech not built for ambisonics
		2. Ogg vorbis
		3. Not ideal - different bit distribution for diff channels
	k. opus
		1. free and open audio codec
		2. ambisonics compression
	l. Creation
		1. Hard
		2. Jump inspector - Android app to preview video
7. Ecosystem
